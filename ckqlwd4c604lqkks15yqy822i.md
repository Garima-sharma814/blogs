# Windows 11 browser layout

I just tried to make windows 11 layout in browser with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. 

Windows 11 provides a calm and creative space where you can pursue your passions through a fresh experience. From a rejuvenated Start menu to new ways to connect to your favorite people, news, games, and content—Windows 11 is the place to think, express, and create in a natural way.

Looking forward to m add more functionalities to make this browser layout more similar to Windows11.
