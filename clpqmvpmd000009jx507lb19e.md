It's been a while since I wrote a blog. I usually cover topics related to the things I know in tech. I should share my developer's journey in a startup this time.

#### TL;DR

This blog contains my journey in a startup company. Everything I share here is entirely my beliefs and thoughts. I've been working as a software developer in a startup [iDream Education](https://idreameducation.org/) for 2 years now. Therefore, I am sharing my insights, and my thoughts on working as a dev in this company. I hope it helps you decide whether working in a startup is something you'd consider and provides a glimpse into the workings of early-stage startups.

### Earlier in 2021 ...

From the start, I believed working in startups was a great way to learn about new things, so I decided to start my career and join a startup where I could take full responsibility for building something meaningful in a product that adds value to people's lives.

Honestly, as a fresher one should be thankful to the organization that saw his/her potential without actually seeing their past experiences and gave them a chance to kick start their career.

[iDream Education](https://idreameducation.org/) is where I started my corporate journey, as a Web Developer and shipped my first line of code in a real-time project. Working at iDream Education is a fantastic experience with amazing community support, providing opportunities to learn something new almost every single day.

In the initial time of mine, I faced a lot of hindrances in my journey like not knowing what and how to do a task. But, this is the phase where one can learn and shape their life. Working in a startup is like gambling, either you fly so high or you fall fast, but you shouldn't forget you can retry anytime.

Be water, my friend! - Bruce Lee. Water can take the shape of the container it is stored in. A startup will help you shape yourself and help you to cope with multiple situations at a time.

### Work Pressures ...

Do not, do not, and do not avoid work pressures. While I understand, that being accountable for your product might frustrating sometimes but will teach you a lot, like, smart work is better than hard work. This is one of the healthy pressures one should deal with in their life. If you avoid work pressure you might lack the ability to manage and organize yourself.

When you work on a product alone you can learn multiple things at a time i.e.

* Multitasking;
    
* handling pressures;
    
* brainstorming;
    
* inter and Intra Teamwork;
    
* understanding human behaviors;
    
* time management;
    
* leadership skills;
    
* consistency;
    
* and many more.
    

### Later in 2023 ...

Still working in the same organization as a Senior Full-Stack Web Developer with better team management skills, better time management skills, higher technical knowledge as compared to myself back in 2021, and many more that I am unaware of.

One can decide to change organizations as per their understanding. I chose to stay committed to this org because I feel it is my responsibility to serve something good to this organization, in return for the skills I've developed.

### Ending quotes ...

If you're a fresher and want to learn new things and experience a thrilling life, you should kick start your journey in a startup and see where your life goes.

Thanks for Reading :)
